# Label Recognition using PyTesseract (OCR)

This project demonstrates how to recognize and extract text from an image using PyTesseract, a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine.

## Project Description

In this project, I worked with a quote image, where the text was successfully recognized and extracted using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).  
After processing, the extracted text was automatically saved in a Notepad file (`New.txt`).

This hands-on experience helped me improve my skills in:
- Text recognition
- Image processing
- File automation using Python

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- PyTesseract
- Pillow (PIL)
- Tesseract-OCR Engine

## How It Works

1. The image file is opened using the Pillow library.
2. PyTesseract extracts the text content from the image.
3. The extracted text is saved in a `.txt` file on your system.

## File Structure

- `main.py` – Python script for OCR processing
- `label recognition` – Sample input image (quote image)
- `New.txt` – Output file containing extracted text
